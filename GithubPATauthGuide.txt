From August 13, 2021, GitHub is no longer accepting account passwords when authenticating Git operations. You need to add a PAT (Personal Access Token) instead, and you can follow the below method to add a PAT on your system.

    Create Personal Access Token on GitHub

    From your GitHub account, go to Settings => Developer Settings => Personal Access Token => Generate New Token (Give your password) => Fillup the form => click Generate token => Copy the generated Token, it will be something like ghp_sFhFsSHhTzMDreGRLjmks4Tzuzgthdvfsrta

Now follow below method based on your machine:

    For Windows OS ⤴

    Go to Credential Manager from Control Panel => Windows Credentials => find git:https://github.com => Edit => On Password replace with with your GitHub Personal Access Token => You are Done

    If you don’t find git:https://github.com => Click on Add a generic credential => Internet address will be git:https://github.com and you need to type in your username and password will be your GitHub Personal Access Token => Click Ok and you are done

    For macOS ⤴

    Click on the Spotlight icon (magnifying glass) on the right side of the menu bar. Type Keychain access then press the Enter key to launch the app => In Keychain Access, search for github.com => Find the internet password entry for github.com => Edit or delete the entry accordingly => You are done

    For a Linux-based OS ⤴

    For Linux, you need to configure the local GIT client with a username and email address,

    $ git config --global user.name "your_github_username"
    $ git config --global user.email "your_github_email"
    $ git config -l

    Once GIT is configured, we can begin using it to access GitHub. Example:

    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
    > Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
    $ Username for 'https://github.com' : username
    $ Password for 'https://github.com' : give your personal access token here

    Now cache the given record in your computer to remembers the token:

    $ git config --global credential.helper cache

    If needed, anytime you can delete the cache record by:

    $ git config --global --unset credential.helper
    $ git config --system --unset credential.helper

    Now try to pull with -v to verify

    $ git pull -v

    Linux/Debian (Clone as follows):

    git clone https://<tokenhere>@github.com/<user>/<repo>.git

    For PhpStorm

    If you are using PhpStorm, go to menu Git => pull and select authentication via Personal Access Token. Enter your PAT it will allow to pull/push the changes.
